Installation:

   OSX:
      git clone git://github.com/luntar/vimfiles.git ~/.vim

   Windows:
      git clone git://github.com/luntar/vimfiles.git ~/vimfiles

Post Install - setting up the .vimrc

  Create symlinks:

    OSX:
       ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc

    Windows:
       %USERPROFILE%\vimfiles\win_setup.bat

More Post Install - refresh the sub modules.

  Switch to the `~/.vim` directory, and fetch submodules:

      cd ~/.vim
      git submodule init
      git submodule update

Notes about Windows:
  Verify that perl.exe is on your path.  Also, make sure xxd.exe is on your path.  I have found this program in the vim installation, e.g. C:\Program Files (x86)\Vim\vim73.  Make sure this is also on you path.  (xxd.exe transforms a file to hex and is used with the HexToggle command, see the vimrc)

  Also on Windows, Bck, the search plug in uses ack.pl; This script must be on your path.  Also note, Bck calls ack, not ack.pl - therefore, you must include '.PL' in your PATHEXT definition.
  This is done by using the assoc tool in a command prompt (cmd.exe).

Misc: 
  The initial setup was configured using the script: inst.sh.  (Windows: I execute this script in the bash shell that comes with the git)
