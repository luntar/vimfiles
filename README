Installation:

   ON OSX or Linux:
      git clone git://github.com/luntar/dotvim.git ~/.vim

    Windows:
      git clone git://github.com/luntar/dotvim.git ~/vimfiles

Setting up the .vimrc

  Create symlinks:

    OSX or Linux:
       ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
       ln -s ~/.vim/gvimrc ~/.gvimrc
    Windows:
       %USERPROFILE%\vimfiles\win_setup.bat

Switch to the `~/.vim` directory, and fetch submodules:

    cd ~/.vim
    git submodule init
    git submodule update


Notes about Windows:
Verify that perl.exe is on your path.  Also, make sure xxd.exe is on your path.  I have found
this program in the vim installation, e.g. C:\Program Files (x86)\Vim\vim73.  Make sure this is also on
you path.  (xxd.exe transforms a file to hex and is used with the HexToggle command, see the vimrc)

Also on Windows, Bck, the seach plugin uses ack.pl; This script must be on your path.
Also note, Bck calls ack, not ack.pl - therfore, you must include '.PL' in your PATHEXT definition.

How the inital repo was created:
The inital setup was configured using the script: inst.sh  (on windows, I execute this script 
in the bash shell that comes with the git distro.)
